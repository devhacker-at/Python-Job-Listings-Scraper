Project Description
In this project, you will build a Python web scraper that collects job listings from the Fake Python Jobs website. The scraper will extract information such as the job title, company name, location, and a link to the full job description.

Because this site is intentionally structured for learning, it’s perfect for beginners. You can focus on understanding HTML structure, selecting elements, and processing data without having to deal with complex anti-scraping protections or legal restrictions.

Project Requirements
Scrape data from https://realpython.github.io/fake-jobs/

Extract the following fields for each job posting:

Job title

Company name

Location

Job detail page URL

Store the results in a CSV file

Use clean, readable Python code

Handle simple edge cases (e.g., missing fields)

Technologies to Use
Python

Requests – to fetch the webpage

Beautiful Soup (bs4) – to parse and navigate HTML

CSV module – to save job listings

What You Will Learn
After completing this project, you will know how to inspect a webpage’s HTML, identify reusable patterns, and extract structured data using Python. You’ll practice working with third-party libraries, organizing scraped data, and exporting it for later analysis. This project also prepares you to move on to more advanced scraping tasks with pagination, filtering, and real-world websites.
