Project Description
In this project, you will build a Python web scraper that collects job listings from the Fake Python Jobs website. The scraper will extract information such as the job title, company name, location, and a link to the full job description.

Because this site is intentionally structured for learning, it’s perfect for beginners. You can focus on understanding HTML structure, selecting elements, and processing data without having to deal with complex anti-scraping protections or legal restrictions.
